Source Documents for the Program Requirements and Specification
The project necessitates the inclusion of correct origination, fill, array, input, and output
addresses. Display of minimum, maximum, and average scores or grades on the console
is expected, utilizing suitable labels and comments throughout the code. Incorporation
of appropriate arithmetic, data movement, and conditional instructions is required. At
least two subroutines with implemented calls should be present. Conditional and
iterative branching should be used for control flow. Effective management of overflow
and storage allocation is needed. Stack management should include PUSH-POP
operations, while save-restore operations should be conducted. A pointer should be
incorporated, ASCII conversion operations executed, and suitable system call directives
applied.
