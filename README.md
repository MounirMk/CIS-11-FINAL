# CIS-11-FINAL

Introduction
# 1.1 Purpose
The program's goal is to calculate and display the minimum, maximum, and average of 5
test scores provided by the user. It also converts these scores into letter grades.
# 1.2 Intended Audience and Users
The primary audience includes teachers, educational administrators, or any user
needing to process and analyze sets of test scores.
# 1.3 Product Scope
The program is intended to analyze test scores and provide quick assessments of
student performance.
# 1.4 Reference
Source Documents for the Program Requirements and Specification
The project necessitates the inclusion of correct origination, fill, array, input, and output
addresses. Display of minimum, maximum, and average scores or grades on the console
is expected, utilizing suitable labels and comments throughout the code. Incorporation
of appropriate arithmetic, data movement, and conditional instructions is required. At
least two subroutines with implemented calls should be present. Conditional and
iterative branching should be used for control flow. Effective management of overflow
and storage allocation is needed. Stack management should include PUSH-POP
operations, while save-restore operations should be conducted. A pointer should be
incorporated, ASCII conversion operations executed, and suitable system call directives
applied.
# 2. Overall Description
# 2.1 Product Perspective
The primary program objectives are to facilitate test score analysis and improve grading
efficiency.
# 2.2Product Functions
The overall description of functionality:
The program receives user input of test scores, performs calculations to find the
minimum, maximum, and average, converts scores into letter grades, and displays the
results.
Technical functionality
The program uses subroutines, arithmetic operations, conditional operations,
branching, data handling, stack operations, ASCII conversions, and system calls.
# 2.3 User Classes and Characteristics
The users include those familiar with the LC-3 assembly language and those needing to
process and analyze test scores.
# 2.4 Operating Environment
The program will be run in an LC-3 simulator.
2.5Design and Implementation Constraints
Constraints include the limitations of the LC-3 assembly language and simulator.
# 2.6Assumptions and Dependencies
This program is dependent on the LC-3 simulator for execution.
# 3. External Interface Requirements
# 3.1 User Interfaces
The user interfaces with the program through the LC-3 simulator console.
# 3.2 Hardware Interfaces
The program can be run on any computer capable of running the LC-3 simulator.
# 3.3 Software Interfaces
The program requires the LC-3 simulator software.
# 3.4 Communications Interface
The application does not require web, Internet, or network connectivity.
# 4. Detailed Description of Functional requirements
# 4.1 Type of Requirement (summarize from Section 2.2)
The functions include input of test scores, calculation of minimum, maximum, and
average scores, conversion of numeric scores into letter grades, and display of results.
Inputs are user-provided test scores, and outputs are the calculated minimum,
maximum, average, and letter grades. The data is stored internally within the program
while it executes.
# 4.2 Performance requirements
What is the expected performance level of the program?
The expected performance level of the program involves accurate computation and
display of the minimum, maximum, and average test scores, as well as correct
conversion of numeric scores into letter grades. The program should respond promptly
to user input. Its performance will largely depend on the capabilities of the hardware
running the LC-3 simulator.

# 4.3 Flow Chart OR Pseudocode.
Main Program:
Initialize an array of size 5 for storing test scores
Initialize variables for minimum, maximum, and sum to store the respective values
For i from 0 to 4:
Prompt the user for input
Store the input in the ith index of the array
Set the minimum and maximum to the first score
Set sum to 0
For each score in the array:
Call subroutine CalculateLetterGrade with score as parameter
If the score is less than the minimum, update the minimum
If the score is more than the maximum, update the maximum
Add the score to the sum
Calculate the average as sum/5
Display the minimum, maximum, and average scores
Subroutine CalculateLetterGrade(score):
If the score is between 0 and 50, display 'F'
Else if the score is between 60 and 69, display 'D'
Else if the score is between 70 and 79, display 'C'
Else if the score is between 80 and 89, display 'B'
Else if the score is between 90 and 100, display 'A'
