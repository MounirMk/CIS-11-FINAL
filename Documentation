Main Program:

Initialize an array of size 5 for storing test scores

Initialize variables for minimum, maximum, and sum to store the respective values

For i from 0 to 4:

Prompt the user for input

Store the input in the ith index of the array

Set the minimum and maximum to the first score

Set sum to 0

For each score in the array:

Call subroutine CalculateLetterGrade with score as parameter

If the score is less than the minimum, update the minimum

If the score is more than the maximum, update the maximum

Add the score to the sum

Calculate the average as sum/5

Display the minimum, maximum, and average scores

Subroutine CalculateLetterGrade(score):

If the score is between 0 and 50, display 'F'

Else if the score is between 60 and 69, display 'D'

Else if the score is between 70 and 79, display 'C'

Else if the score is between 80 and 89, display 'B'

Else if the score is between 90 and 100, display 'A
